## Summary

You’ve just been recently hired at Bob's Wacky Words, the company behind many of the best known wacky word based board games. Unfortunately one of the company’s more recent games was too complicated in the way that it scored the players, so in order to increase the sales of the game the company has asked you to develop an app to do the scoring automatically.

They've already got the game portion of the program written (get it here!Preview the document), they just need your help with the score calculation functions.

## Program Requirements

For this program, I will write five (5) functions with the following names and behaviors:

1. **most_repeated_letters(word_1)** - calculates and returns the highest number of repeated letters in a word.
2. **has_equal_letters(word_2)** - checks whether the number of vowels in the word is equal to the number of consonants; returns True if the number of vowels is the same as the number of consonants, False if it is not.is_palindrome(word_3) - checks whether the word is the same read backwards as forwards; returns True if it is and False if it is not.
3. **total_points(word)** - uses the three previous functions to calculate and return the total number of points a given word has earned.
4. **is_trick_round(p1_word, p2_word)** - counts the total number of 'y' characters in both words; returns True if there is an odd number and False if the total is even.
