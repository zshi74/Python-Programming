## Summary
If you use many popular internet forums, you may already be familiar with Markdown (Links to an external site.) syntax for formatting text online. It's very common because it's quite easy to convert from Markdown to HTML using some basic string operations (concatenation, slicing, indexing) â€“ and that's exactly what you're going to do this week.

## Program Structure

1. **paragraph(line)** - takes in a line of text and returns the line with paragraph tags.
2. **header(line)** - takes in a line of text and returns the line with header tags.
3. **em(line)** - takes in a line of text and returns the line with emphasis tags.
4. **link(line)** - takes in a line of text and returns the line with link tags.
5. **convert(input_file, output_file)** - takes in two file names, reads markdown text from the input file, converts it to HTML and writes it to the output file.
