## Program: Company Favoritism

For the past few years, the ideas of diversity and inclusion have been marketed to companies as a tool to enhance team performance. The benefits of establishing and encouraging a diverse workplace help both the individuals as well as the company.

Unfortunately, unconscious and unintentional biases can lead some people to be hired and/or promoted more frequently than others. Though these very small biases seem insignificant, the cumulative effects within a larger system can be harmful.

In this program, I will be modeling the impacts of implicit biases within a company. Most employees would not consider themselves to be discriminatory, yet companies today still lack diverse work environments (check out Google’s diversity statistics). This is due to the fact that people have unintentional biases that can affect their treatment of others, whether they realize it or not.

## Program: Ditto

You are out for a pleasant Pokéwalk with your favorite Pokémon, Ditto.

Ditto has the ability to absorb the powers and mimic the appearance of other Pokémon you encounter. It will be up to you to write a program to help generate these Pokémon and help your Ditto decide whether to add other Pokémon's powers to its repertoire, or let them pass by.

## Program: Hobbes' Night Out

Hobbes has had a long week full of grading exams and taking lectures and she’s exhausted by the end of it. So she decides its time to have some fun! Hobbes heads to the bar nearest to her home for some good old shots of Fireball. As the evening turns into night, Hobbes realizes she's had what one might call ‘one too many’ drinks, so it's time to go home. What makes her journey back home difficult is that there’s a nasty hole on the road (which she soberly avoided on the way to the bar). Now the question is: Can she make it home??

Write a program to find out if Hobbes makes it safely back home or not.

The program takes as input the amount of alcohol consumed to derive a ‘level’ of inebriation. Based on this level, the walk pattern and step length changes. (There are multiple walk patterns, like ‘for every 5 steps forward, take 2 steps back’ and so on.) Step lengths can vary.

The program will also need to know the distance to Hobbes’s home, and then run a simulation of Hobbes’s dangerous journey to her house. The program should store Hobbes’s location at each step in a list; if she steps in the pothole, output: “Oh no! Hobbes fell near the bar!” and if she makes it home, output: “Hurray! Hobbes makes it through the day!” and return the location list.

## Program: Markdown Magic

If you use many popular internet forums, you may already be familiar with Markdown (Links to an external site.) syntax for formatting text online. It's very common because it's quite easy to convert from Markdown to HTML using some basic string operations (concatenation, slicing, indexing) – and that's exactly what you're going to do this time.

## Program: Spa Day


The UW–Madison Doctor of Physical Therapy program runs a Massage Fundraiser every semester (they do, for real, it's awesome), offering massages to students all day:

* $20 for a 15-minute massage
* $30 for a 30-minute massage
* $60 for a 60-minute massage

We'll be writing a program to help the physical therapy students schedule their days and calculate how much money they will be raising for the Doctor of Physical Therapy program.

## Program: The Game of Loops

In the Free city of Braavos lies the Iron Bank. Legend has it that it is a bank unlike any other. You can't run from them, you can't cheat them, you can't sway them with excuses. Queen Daenerys wants to open an account in the Iron Bank. The Lords of the Iron Bank ask her to set a password that cannot be broken. They have some strange criteria for the password, which must be met:

1. No letters should repeat.
2. The number of vowels should not be odd.
3. At least one special character from the set {@, #, *, $} must be present.
4. The only numbers allowed are those divisible by either 2 or 3.

The Iron Bank needs help in verifying if the password set by the queen is valid. Please help the Lords of the Iron Bank design a program that performs this check

## Program: Word Games

You’ve just been recently hired at Bob's Wacky Words, the company behind many of the best known wacky word based board games. Unfortunately one of the company’s more recent games was too complicated in the way that it scored the players, so in order to increase the sales of the game the company has asked you to develop an app to do the scoring automatically.
