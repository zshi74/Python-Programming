## Summary

For the past few years, the ideas of diversity and inclusion have been marketed to companies as a tool to enhance team performance. The benefits of establishing and encouraging a diverse workplace help both the individuals as well as the company. 

Unfortunately, unconscious and unintentional biases can lead some people to be hired and/or promoted more frequently than others. Though these very small biases seem insignificant, the cumulative effects within a larger system can be harmful.

In this program, I will be modeling the impacts of implicit biases within a company. Most employees would not consider themselves to be discriminatory, yet companies today still lack diverse work environments (check out Googleâ€™s diversity statistics). This is due to the fact that people have unintentional biases that can affect their treatment of others, whether they realize it or not.

## Program Structured

1. **create_employee()** - returns a dictionary representing one new randomly generated employee.
2. **create_company(sizes)** - takes in a list of the number of employees at each level and returns a list of those levels, each of which is a list of randomly generated employee dictionaries.
3. **get_pct_favored(company, level)** - takes in a company list and a level to examine, and returns the percent of "favored" employees at that level.
4. **turnover(company, sizes, pct)** - takes in a company list, the sizes list (as in function 2), and a float representing the percent of employees leaving the company, and modifies the company list in place to simulate hiring and promotions.
5. **main(num_simulations, sizes, pct)** - takes in the number of simulations to run, a list of company sizes (for function 2), and a percent of turnover (for function 4), and prints the average percent of "favored" employees at each level over all simulations.
